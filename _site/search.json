Implemented strategies using MiniMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning, and formulated evaluation functions tailored for both NxN and 3x3x3 board dimensions, and tested. Presented outcomes to peers.\nHoloBee Phylogenetics: Sourced data of SeqRNA of bacteria found in bee gut biomes, analyzed and created phylogenetic tree using PHYLIP package. Utilized phylogeography techniques to map bacterial tree to identify bees in the same holobiont community, via clustering. Wrote paper, presented to the Suchard group and peers.\nCirrhosis in SAS: Performing data analysis and predictive modeling in SAS on a dataset regarding clinical trial data on patients with Cirrhosis. Creating visualizations, reports, and other deliverables."
